Vision to Voice: Real-Time AI Narrator (Flask Version)
Vision to Voice is an innovative AI-powered web application that transforms visual content into spoken narratives in real-time. Leveraging advanced computer vision and natural language processing, it generates descriptive captions for images, videos, and live webcam feeds, then converts these captions into speech for accessibility.

Features
Real-Time Captioning: Describe scenes from a live webcam or video in real-time using state-of-the-art models.

Multi-Source Support: Process live webcam feeds, video files, and static images through an intuitive web interface.

Dual AI Models: Uses BLIP for image captioning and Sentence-Transformers for semantic similarity filtering.

Text-to-Speech Output: Converts captions into spoken audio using pyttsx3 for an accessible experience.

Efficient Processing: Skips frames and filters similar captions for optimal resource usage and meaningful narration.

User-Friendly Interface: Modern Flask-based frontend with easy menu navigation.

Visual Output: Captioned images and video frames are saved and served via the Flask app.
